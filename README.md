Gilani's Resturant

OBJECTIVE:

To create a food delivery application using a Figma template as a sample. Then to take it further but adding authentication, shopping cart and database to turn it into a workable application. The application was built using React; its 3rd-party libraries like react-router, redux, and react-icons, along with custom react hooks. It was built with persisting authentication using Firebase's Auth API and and a custom API was built in Firebase's realtime database to hold store and retrieve data (Menu Items) that would be displayed on the website.

BENEFITS FROM PROJECT:

Whilst building this application I learnt how React truely is component-focused and how important these components are for building scalable web applications. I saw the beauty and ease of using redux toolkit as a app-wide state management. Also, how important regex methods can be for validation. I learnt how to convert a figma template into a real webpage and the use of sections in my CSS code.

ADD ON'S IN THE FUTURE:

To take this app further I will do the following:

- add a payment & security system to the order logic,
- create a backend inventory for the meal items.
- email response system.
- create a persisting Cart.

ISSUES TO WORK ON:

- when using gitHub pages persistent Auth works but refreshing/ reloading leads to github pages 404 page. if refreshed from URL it works fine.
- when using safari there are a few glitches with the anchor tags. (This has been fixed using HashLink from React-Router)
